# download_ezshare
Script to grab files from EzShare wifi SD card.
It'll execute `pre_action.sh` before download files and then `execute post_action.sh` after files are downloaded and updated. 

Current configuration is to get files from AirSense11 and plan to upload to SleepHQ using its API automatically. 

Plese config at the top of ImportExShare.sh and take your own risk using it.

Usage: sh ./ImportEzShare.sh
