# download_ezshare
Script to grab files from EzShare wifi SD card.
It'll execute `pre_action.sh` before download files and then `execute post_action.sh` after files are downloaded and updated. 

Current configuration is to get files from AirSense11 and plan to upload to SleepHQ using its API automatically.
